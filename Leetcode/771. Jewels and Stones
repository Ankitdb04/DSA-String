You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones) {
        int i=jewels.length()-1;
        
        int count=0;
        while(i>=0){
            int j=stones.length()-1;
            while(j>=0){
                if(jewels.charAt(i)==stones.charAt(j)){
                    count++;
                }
                j--;
            }
            i--;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
